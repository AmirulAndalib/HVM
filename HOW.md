Just kidding.

Thanks to a new model of computation, the Interaction Net, which is the elegant
child of the Lambda Calculus with the Turing Machine, on which the universe was
programmed. This model isn't new, but, until recently, all its practical
implementations suffered from inefficiencies due to overwhelming pointer
indirections. Thanks to a new memory format, we were able to redesign the
algorithm and obtain a massive speedup, making it finally feasible, and paving
way to the inevitable functional, parallel future of computation. For more
information. 

TODO: explain

* Why it doesn't need a garbage collector, and how memory management works

* How the implicit parallelism works and what are its limitations

* What is beta-optimality and why it makes HOVM exponentially faster than GHC
  for very high-order inputs

* The breakthroughs that allowed it to finally be efficient in practice
