High-Order Virtual Machine (HOVM)
=================================

High-Order Virtual Machine (HOVM) is a functional runtime. It is **lazy** (like
Haskell), **non-garbage-collected** (like Rust), **massively parallel** (like
CUDA) and has a **cost model** (like the EVM). It aims to become the ultimate
compilation target for the inevitable parallel, functional future of computing.
